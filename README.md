### Welcome To HunterDAO

HunterDAO is a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) that invests in early NFT projects, and aims to empower the NFT industry and future creator economy.

### Inspiration

Inspired by CultDAO which invests in early Token projects, hunterDAO wanna be build a decentralized Venture Capital focused on early NFTs, to provide funds to support very potential artists and NFT creators to start their project.

The DAO community determine which NFT project to invest, and all investment incomes will return to the community.

### **What it does**

### **(1) Invest to Earn**

The basic business is to invest and earn. When users transact HUNTER tokens, the DAO Management Fee will be collected into the Treasury. Every time the treasury accumulate 21 ETH, it will be sent automatically to an approved project wallet address as an investment.

When the invested NFT projects launch, in return, they will share part of their NFT Royalty to the DAO as well as other rewards (i.e NFTs, Whitelist quality) .

HunterDAO will make investing in NFT projects much more easier, and provides opportunity for web3 users to find future UNICON projects in the very early stage, and gain rich return for their excellent vision and correct choice.

### **(2)Which to invest is the community choice**

As a decentralized Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) , HunterDAO has its governance mechanism: that the community members vote and decide which project to invest.

The Top 50 holders submit the proposal, and the others vote on that. Since the investment return will be distributed to all the holders according to their shares, it makes the voting results meet the best interest of community and will lead a healthy growth of the DAO. 

### (3) **A Bounty platform connecting Web3 Protocols + NFT artists and creators:**

HunterDAO has also a “Bounty Hunting”section, where the Protocols can post their Bounty Task, and call for artists to compete.

For example, a protocol can call for a NFT Souvenir Design for its brand, here in HunterDAO there are lots of artists who submit their art works for competition. And the community will vote on all the works and choose severail winners, and all the winners share the Bounty. For the Protocol, they get original NFT works at lower cost,  but gain more community exposure and buzz for its event; For the artists get the bounty while their talent are seen by more people. For the voters they will get voting rewards.

HunterDAO make it possible for everyone to attend the decentralized governance, and to share the DAO benefits based on their involvement

**Bounty Hunting:**

The third-party protocols set a Bounty Task on the DAO, and artists will submit their art works to compete, the community vote on the works.

### How we built it**

We have analyzed the market need, and current NFT industry situations and problems, then We decided to build a DAO to resolve the problems, and bring these values to the new WEB3 users.

###  **Challenges we ran into**

We find the marketing is the a challenge to us, we hope to attend in this hackathon and let our ideas known by more people. And we’d love to hear more voice and suggestion to improve the product.

### **Accomplishments that we're proud of**

We spent more than 30 days building it, and now the UI is complete, the main functions of SATKE, PROPOSAL, VOTE are ready in testnet.

### **What's next for HunterDAO**

-Airdrop & Launch on mainnet

-Invest and incubate the first NFT projects

-Complete the Bounty Hunting Section

-Future NFT launchpad and NFT market sections
